# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: GIT is a version control management tool that developers use - collectively - to organize and share code revisions with one another (all based on that centralize / logical repository).  There is a (limited) free version or GIT & a paid version which provides more - advanced - features.

GitHub is the actual 'cloud' engine where all the code revisions / repositories are eventually housed - uploaded by developers.


Researched answer:
GIT, which stands for 'Global Information Tracking', is a version control system that is used by developers from all parts of the world.  GIT helps developers track multiple versions of code / scripts as that code is updated over a period of time. Moreso, GIT / GitHub provides a seamless process to where asynchronous communications / sharing of various sets of code revisions can continue to be worked on - by different developers - all while maintaining order & integrity of the entire set of coding scripts among that collective group of developers.  This is acheived by managing who is granted access to the GitHub organization and utilizing Git commands - cloning, push, pull, merges, etc...

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer:  I know the AND (&&) OR (||) and the NOT (!) operators returns (TRUE / FALSE) boolean values but may be overthinking the questions b/c those 'initial' BOOLEAN results then lead - if TRUE or FALSE - to a triggered action of execution based on the BOOLEAN value. Thus, I think the answer is AND, OR, NOT as those three give the results TRUE (1) or FALSE (0).

Researched answer:  Turns out the AND (&&), OR (||), NOT (!) operators which as labeled as 'Logical' operators are paired with Boolean (logical) values; thus, they return a Boolean (True / False) result.

However, research from MDN web docs advised that the && and || operators could also return non-Boolean values when used with non-Boolean values other than TRUE / FALSE. Thus, I think that's what I was trying to state in my, initial, answer.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer:  the 'index' in Javascrip is stating the actual position or location - starting with the number 'zero' within an associative or number arraay.  This 'index' value is used with loop functions when needing to search / interate through an array in search of a specific 'conditional' statement within the loop.

Researched answer: the 'index' 

the 'index' is return by using a method named, indexOf() within JavaScript to which the 1st index (position) of a specified value is displayed.  By default, the index is search from LEFT to RIGHT - again - starting with the 'zero'; not the number ONE as the 1st index / position.

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings.

Your answer:  Arrays is a list or group of values (elements) that are grouped in what I think is considered a 'container' - the array.  The array is then able to compile or house an abundant amount of data of different types - strings, numbers, even other arrays - all within that (array) container to later be called via methods - extracting the values based on their assigned index.

A string consist of charactures - letters and/or numbers - and sit within single or double quotes.  Strings can not house multiple or 'different' sets of data like an array; All data that is within the quotes is bound to that specific string as one value.

Researched answer:  

A string sotres values similar to arrays in that indexes are zero-based with the 1st character  being logiced in position 0 which is same for arrays (1st element logged in position 0).  Note: a string object is used to represent a set of characters set to that string.  There are two forms of strings - primitive and objects to which primatives are immutable - meaning, they can not be altered.  String objects house a series of characters - sames as primitive strings - but also allow said string object to be called by methods which primitive strings does not allow methods.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer:  Pair programming is when two or more developers converge on the same set of coding objectives - either working from the same computer or collaborating, remotely, via tools such as Zoom, etc... to view the same set of code (in real time) to communicate & work on the code 'collective' together.  With pair programming - one of the two developers usefully have control 'one-at-a-time' to update the code while the other developer provides input / feedback.  Note: having control of code changes will alternate between the two developers, accordingly giving each a chance to act as the 'driver' while the other facilitates as the 'navigator'.

Researched answer:  Pair programming, an Agile software development technique, was originated from Extreme programming (XP) to which two developers collaborator together on the same computer to complete code work.  Is is defined that the 'driver' is considered the developer who is 'active' coding at the keyboard while the other developers labeled the 'navigator' is viewing - i.e. monitoring the coding actions of the other developer - to provide feedback.  To be successful with pair programming, clear communication is vital by both developers during the interaction.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions:  a Higher Order Function (HOF) takes one of more functions as arguments (i.e. a procedural parameter, which a parameter of a procedure that is itself a procedure), returns a function as a result.  Note: this definition taken from 'Wilipedia' - best answer to explain in my opinon.

2. Jest:  Jest is a JavaScript unit test framework which is designed to enforce integrity of the actual codebase scripts.  Jest is an NPM package and one of the more populer test runners being used by most JS / React projects.

3. Objects: A javascript object is a 'standalone' entity which have properties and type; an entity having state and behaviour (properties and method).

4. Method:  A JavaScript method is a property of an object that contains a function definition.  Methods are functions stored as object properties.

5. Classes:  A JavaScript class is like a 'blueprint' of the object.  JS classes encapsulates data and function that then manipulates the data with the class.
